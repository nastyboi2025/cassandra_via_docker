brief history

originally develped by facebook in 2008.
was designed for inbox searching
founded on the principles of googles BigTable and Amazons Dynamo
one of the founders of cassandra worked on both BigTable and Dynamo.

cassandra combines the distributed nature of dynamo with the data model of bigtable.

fb open sourced in 2008. in 2010 it became a top level apache project.

netflix migrated from oracle to cassandra
apple also uses cassandra

	node
node		node

node		node
	node

all data that is stored in casandra is associated with a token.
massive token values.

if there is 1 node then thus one node has all token values
as new nodes added each new node takes over some contiguous set of token values and storing the data assicated with it.
